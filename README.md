* Integration of modloaders (Forge and Fabric)
* Integration of OptiFine (from 1.14.2 to 1.20.1)
* Can run almost any version from alpha to 1.20.1
* Skins system (still in development)
* bat files (run directly without opening the launcher)
* Cracked minecraft sessions

## Downloads

The launcher requires java to work properly. If you don't have java Installed you can download it from here: [JDK 17](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.8_windows-x64_bin.exe)

Download .Jar version:

[OSLauncher.jar](https://oscar395.github.io/oslauncher-repository/launcher_release/OSLauncher.jar)

Download .exe version:

[OSLauncher_.exe](https://oscar395.github.io/oslauncher-repository/launcher_release/OSLauncher_.exe)

If you want to use the .exe version you will probably need to configure the system's environment variables [see how to do it](https://www.pchardwarepro.com/como-configurar-java_home-en-windows-10/)

If you want to play older versions like 1.16.5 you have to install Java 8: [JRE 8](https://www.java.com/es/download/ie_manual.jsp)

The launcher is only available for windows for now.

## Known Issues
* Sometimes the game will not launch if you are using the default Jre 8 path, you can change it in the settings and put the normal java 8 installation path, this might happen if you have an old graphics card
* Forge is only supported for 1.7.10 to 1.20.1 if you try to run an older version the game wont launch
* If you are using an Ely.by account you have use the default runtime path so the authlib injector can work
* If the .exe launcher does not work, you can try with the .jar version
