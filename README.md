## Downloads

This requires java to run properly. If you don't have java Installed you can download it from here: [JDK 17](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.8_windows-x64_bin.exe)

Download .exe version:

[OSLauncher_.exe](https://oscar395.github.io/oslauncher-repository/launcher-release/OSLauncher_.exe)

Download .Jar version:

[OSLauncher.jar](https://oscar395.github.io/oslauncher-repository/launcher-release/OSLauncher.jar)

If you want to play older versions like 1.16.5 you have to install Java 8: [JRE 8](https://www.java.com/es/download/ie_manual.jsp)

## Known Issues
* Sometimes the game will not launch if you are using the default Jre 8 path, you can change it in the settings and put the normal java 8 installation path, this might happen if you have an old graphics card
* Forge is only supported for 1.7.10 to 1.20.1 if you try to run an older version the game wont launch
* If you are using an Ely.by account you have use the default runtime path so the authlib injector can work
* If the .exe launcher does not work, you can try with the .jar version
