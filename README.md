This project has been made with the intention of provinding an alternative for the already existing minecraft launchers, made to be lightweight and easy to use, it also provides OptiFine installation within the launcher.These are the features that the launcher already offers:

* Integration of modloaders (Forge and Fabric)
* Integration of OptiFine (from 1.14.2 to 1.20.1)
* Can run almost any version from alpha to 1.20.1
* Skins system (still in development)
* bat files (run the game directly without opening the launcher)
* Cracked minecraft sessions

## Downloads

The launcher requires java to work properly. If you don't have java Installed you can download it from here: [JDK 17](https://download.oracle.com/java/17/archive/jdk-17.0.8_windows-x64_bin.exe)

Download .Jar version:

[OSLauncher.jar](https://oscar395.github.io/oslauncher-repository/launcher_release/OSLauncher.jar)

Download .exe version:

[OSLauncher_.exe](https://oscar395.github.io/oslauncher-repository/launcher_release/OSLauncher_.exe)

If you want to use the .exe version you will probably need to configure the system's environment variables [see how to do it](https://www.pchardwarepro.com/como-configurar-java_home-en-windows-10/)

If you want to play older versions like 1.16.5 you have to install Java 8: [JRE 8](https://www.java.com/es/download/ie_manual.jsp)

The launcher is only available for windows for now.

## Known Issues
* Sometimes the game will not launch if you are using the default Jre 8 path, you can change it in the settings and put the normal java 8 installation path, this might happen if you have an old graphics card
* Forge is only supported for 1.7.10 to 1.20.1 if you try to run an older version the game wont launch
* If you are using an Ely.by account you have use the default runtime path so the authlib injector can work
* If the .exe launcher does not work, you can try with the .jar version
